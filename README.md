# Glossa

Language learning tool to make sentence mining easier and faster. Turn any sentence into an editable, contextâ€‘aware flashcard and sync it to Anki.

> Workâ€‘inâ€‘progress student project: React + TypeScript (frontend), Express/Node (backend), PostgreSQL (Prisma), Supabase Auth, Tailwind CSS, and optional Ankiâ€‘Connect integration.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Sentence â†’ Flashcard**: Select a sentence, tokenize it (e.g., `Intl.Segmenter` / languageâ€‘specific segmenters), pick a word, and autoâ€‘generate a definition using an LLM API (currently using DeepSeek API).
* **Contextâ€‘aware definitions**: Definitions can consider the full sentence rather than a single token in isolation.
* **Editable preview**: Edit front/back, add examples, pitch/reading, tags, etc. before saving. (coming soon)
* **Anki sync (local)**: Send cards to Anki via **Ankiâ€‘Connect** from the web UI or a Chrome extension.
* **Auth**: Supabase Auth for signâ€‘in.
